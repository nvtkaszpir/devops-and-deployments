# Devops & Deployments

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nvtkaszpir/devops-and-deployments.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nvtkaszpir/devops-and-deployments)

## About

This is a (yet-to-be-defined) game for Devops about Deployments ;)

The general idea is to create game focusing on current IT Operations
challenges, or app development in general.

## Origin

Credits to Micha≈Ç Pawluk for original name, expressed around
2019-07-19 14:00 in our room at work.

Some suggestions were expressed over IRC @ freenode.

## Project goal

- create usable assets to perform a game, such as:

  + player chart
  + campaign scenarios
  + game play - `how to play` descriptions
  + exploration, interaction, combat
  + game master guidelines

- focus on doing fast-paced and fun-focused game play for newbies,
  so don't make it super serious to the letter.

## TODO

### Technical

- switch to RST?

### Non-technical

- maybe use GitHub Project or something like Trello?
- shorten name, maybe to `d16d`?
  Why `d16d` ? Well, looking at how Kubernetes was abbreviated -
  squeeze 8 chars in kubernetes word and you get k8s - it was quite
  obvious to squeeze `Devops & Deployments` down to `d16d`.
  Also `D&D`  would confuse quite a lot of people, not to mention about legal infringements.
- read about RPG games because `ihavenoideawhatamidoing.jpeg`

  + define game system, suggestions:

    * [d20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_System)
    * [GURPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS)
    * [table top games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_game)
    * [Storytelling system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling_System)
    * [Talisman game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talisman_(board_game))

  + look around for already existing implementations that can be easily adjusted:
  
    * muds
    * web apps
    * discord bots
    * IRC bots, even the old ones in TCL
    * table top games, card games
    * [dungeon_brawl](https://github.com/jness/dungeon_brawl)
    This is is insanely awesome, I think it could be used in here!
    * [dnd tl;dr](https://github.com/Miserlou/dnd-tldr)
    * [Unicorn Simulator](https://toggl.com/startup-simulator/)
      super simple but quite easy to adjust

- choose license, probably Open Game License with Open Game Content
- guidelines:
  + add guidelines for players only
  + add guidelines for game master only if needed
