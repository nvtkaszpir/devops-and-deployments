# Devops & Deployments

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nvtkaszpir/devops-and-deployments.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nvtkaszpir/devops-and-deployments)

## About

This is a (yet-to-be-defined) game for Devops about Deployments ;)

The general idea is to create game somewhat similar to Dungeons & Dragons but
in completely different setup, focusing on current IT Operations challenges,
or general app development.

## Origin

Credits to Micha≈Ç Pawluk for original name, expressed around
2019-07-19 14:00 in our room at work.

Some suggestions were expressed over IRC @ freenode.

## Project goal

- create usable assets to perform a game, such as:
  - player chart
  - campaign scenarios
  - game play - `how to play` descriptions
  - exploration, interaction, combat
  - game master guidelines
- focus on doing fast-paced and fun-focused game play for newbies,
  so don't make it super serious to the letter.

## General ideas

Feel free to add suggestions. This should be later split into separate docs.

- define your character
- the mission is to fulfill successful challenge in given constraints, for example:
  - time limit
  - budget
  - what defines mission success, for example in edge cases the fact that FTP
    upload worked is enough :D

- if not using campaigns, then game should be rouge like, so the setup is
  randomly generated at start, examples:
  - you inherit legacy system, throw a dice to define how many years ago it
    was installed and not updated
  - you create a new app, throw a dice to define number of dependencies,
    and for each dependency throw if it has breaking dependencies
  - throw a dice to define system complexity, and for each what app stack
    was used, so for example we got system with 6 services, 2 of them in
    Java, 2 in Python, 1 in Go, 1 in PHP
  - throw a dice to decide what operating system you use
  - do you have cloud providers
  - automation tools (if any)

## Very loose ideas

- world map - actually should be a problem to solve, like an area from start to
  end with traps in modern app development (yeah, agile and stuff...)
- explore phase - discovering the problem area, dependencies among issues,
  tech stack, budget
- interactions - ?
- combat - actually it is just problem solving in action!
- monsters - problems itself (we don't have problems, we have challenges...),
  what about allies? also this depends on the stack, so will need to define
  deps (like you have no java problems if you are php-only shop)
- spells - should be rather just using general skills in solving problems
- loot - if any? this is actually just an experience in practice, or buffs for skills

- [Characters](Characters.md)
- [Campaigns](Campaigns.md)

## TODO

### Technical

- add GitHub issues template
- switch to RST?

### Non-technical

- shorten name, maybe to `d16d`?
  Why `d16d` ? Well, looking at how Kubernetes was abbreviated -
  squeeze 8 chars in kubernetes word and you get k8s - it was quite
  obvious to squeeze `Devops & Deployments` down to `d16d`.
  Also `D&D`  would confuse quite a lot of people, not to mention about legal infringements.

- read about RPG games because ihavenoideawhatamidoing.jpeg
- define game system, suggestions:
  - [d20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_System)
  - [GURPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS)
- choose license, probably Open Game License with Open Game Content

- add guidelines for players only
- add guidelines for game master only
