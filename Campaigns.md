# Campaigns

Example entry scenarios:

- It's friday 16:00 and you try to fix failing builds, when PO enters
  and says to set up new env because they got new customer on the horizon.
- You have 10 workdays to create new microservice while team is
  in crunch mode for over 6 months already.
- You just inherited legacy system and it needs update, current admins
  are under intensive medical care because they were driving the same bus.
- Lift & shift monolith to the cloud in 5 days.
- During deployment something went horribly wrong and data is being
  corrupted with every request.
