# Character

Work in progress.

## Class

Instead of race we got class (don't cringe too much):

- dev: frontend, backend, fullstack, tester
- operations: admins, sre, security, helpdesk
- analytics (architects/bi/designers)
- management (project managers, product owners, scrum managers)

Todo:

- how to handle modern solutions that devs are on call?

## Alignment

[Reference](http://easydamus.com/alignment.html)

Two axes:

- good-evil
- lawful-chaotic

TODO: add some life examples like:

- Bill Gates
- Bob Ross
- Elon Musk
- Linus Torvalds
- Steve Jobs

## Abilities

TODO:

- add here maybe something like work-life balance (instead of Focus?)

The really ugly mapping from D&D to IT:

1. Tech - (strength) how good you know given things practically (vs soft skills?)
2. Lean - (dexterity) ability to align to changes (knows more but at lower level)
3. Focus - (constitution) how long can you work to solve issue,
persistence vs easy to distract
4. Seniority - (wisdom) experience/gut feeling
5. Leadership - (charisma) - in general better talking

## Skills

Skills to pick:

- db: non-relational, relational
- dev: frontend, backend, mobile
- automation
- providers: on-prem, cloud
- infra: bare metal, vm, containers
- networking
- security
- testing: unit, system, performance, pentest
- storage: files, object, caching
- logging
- metrics
- chaos engineering
- big data
- stream processing
- ml, ai
- level: high level (app focused) vs low level (closer to hardware)
- cryptocurrencies

TODO:

- expand list with some more modern buzzwords
- rearrange to more genric groups
- find that webpage which shows X types of people in projects and how to handle
  them (it had cool icons on black background)
